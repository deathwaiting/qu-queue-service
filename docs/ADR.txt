- Why quarkus ?
    -- this system design assumes variable events will be executed when customer will be enqueued and picked up.
        --- for example a pickup can send emails to next client in queue, or update a screen in office.
    -- the variable events work with an event driven system, which can be provided by vert.x event bus architecture
    -- quarkus is built upon vert.x , providing the ability to use its event bus, and much more other features for
    web development using its eco-system of extensions.
    -- quarkus has very good performance
        --- supports vert.x event-loop model
        --- supports reactive paradigms
        --- supports reactive database access.
        --- supports native builds on graalvm, which can darsitically reduce startup time and memory footprint
        --- container and cloud native and its native builds can be uses with serverless services.
- Why postgres ?
    -- mature database
    -- i am used to it
    -- it should support my needs, has native support for JSON types and indexing , and many other features
    -- it has reactive clients that are supported by quarkus
    -- its performance was very good compared to mongodb
    -- it has connection pooling solution like pgBouncer that can make thousand of connections available.
- Why hibernate-reactive with panache?
    -- i was considering several solutions, but the most requirement was having reactive db client support:
        --- quarkus supports vert.x postgres reactive client, but it was very low level with ton of boiler plate
        --- quarkus supports vanilla hibernate and JPA , but it is not reactive and will use jdbc which is blocking
        --- thought of using jooq + vert.x postgres client using this but was not sure about its integration with quarkus
            specially the native build, which requires no use of reflection:
            https://github.com/jklingsporn/vertx-jooq
        --- considered using a quarkus extension that integrates jooq, but it used the agroal pool which is a jdbc
            connection pool
        -- i was considering using quarkus + spring reactive client + r2dbc
           --- the r2dbc client does bean mapping and some other goodies when writing sql, similar to JDBI library.
           --- it was tested in earlier project and worked
           --- but native build was not guaranteed , as it probably uses reflection.
        --- then i noticed that the latest version supported reactive-hibernate + panache which was the best solution
            at time. reactive-hibernate natively uses reactive clients for postgres, but had some boiler plate.
            ---- but as being integrated with quarkus, i am now more confident that i will have less problems with
                 builds, also the panache supports should make boiler plate much less.

- queues event system
     -- certain events are triggered on certain queue events
        --- ex: when a customer is enqueued, we can send an email or an sms to him with his turn info.
        --- these events are variable, as each queue may have different needs
        --- these events have types, some are filters, that decides if the action should continue, or may override the
        action.
            * ex: if a customer is picked after being skipped twice, he should be ejected from the queue instead!
        --- but we can't use reflection with such events to improve performance and to use CDI injection and native builds
        --- this is where we can make use of vert.x!
     -- each event handler is a vert.x verticle !
        --- instead of creating handlers at runtime using reflection, each event handler is actually a vert.x verticle
        --- so, it is more of a service that is on standby, waiting for events to be published to it from any queue.
        --- this gives us flexibility of architecture, as we can reference these events by just names and publish events
            by type on the bus, and they will pick it up.
        --- depending on the event operation, we can make the verticle as IO eventloop or worker thread verticle.
        --- and this opens the door for extensibility , as vert.x event bus can be connected over several deployments.
            which means we can add events without need for code modifications or downtime.
     -- as events are a code and a bunch of data[name, type, description, parameters class, sample parameter]
        --- so an event will be an implementation of an interface QueueEvent
        --- the event handler will be inside the event class
        --- the event name will be assumed to be the class qualifying name, or static constant provided by the class
        --- each event should implement a static method the returns QueueEventInfo containing its static data
        --- active event classes will be grouped inside class QueueEvents, an event will be registered by calling its
            getInfo() static method.
        --- the class will build a map of events info at startup, events with similar names will simply cause startup
         error.
