- adding events for request/accept/deny/enqueue/dequeue may add a restriction on required data by clients.
- add required data to client_details, means these will be shown to the client in the request form as required fields , and they will be validated as well when the request is provided.
- this means :
    -- we should have a variable list of required details per-queue
    -- adding event to the queue, may add to this list
    -- creating a request will validate the client details
    -- these validations will be variable as well using the event bus.
