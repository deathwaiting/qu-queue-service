- as for quarkus 11, i couldn't run liquibase along hibernate-reactive, as hibernate reactive cannot work with jdbc
properties provided , and liquibase uses jdbc properties to get the database connection.
- it seems all classes with public properties are processed by quarkus to create properties for them at compile time,
need to test more , put this is not just done to panache entities.
- cannot use panache entities, an probably even hibernate-reactive session in tests, i get his error
"java.lang.AssertionError: This needs to be run on the Vert.x event loop"
    -- seems they made a specific implementation of the session for quarkus, and it can't be used without vert.x io
    event loop
    -- this means i can't use it in my tests to check the changes in the database.
